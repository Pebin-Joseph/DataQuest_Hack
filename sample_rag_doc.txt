This is a sample project brief for the Live RAG demo.
The RAG system watches the data folder, indexes documents in real time, and answers questions.
Key facts:
- The backend runs FastAPI on port 8000.
- The vector index is stored in Chroma at ./vector_db.
- Models: llama3.2 for generation, nomic-embed-text for embeddings.
- Citations include the document name and page number.
